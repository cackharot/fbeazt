      <li class="answer">We have a specialized delivery team who make sure to
        get your food as soon as possible. We also requested the restaurants to make this in priority.

        restaurants peak time, food availablity, etc., We will make sure to contact you if your order
        is getting delayed. So for now considering these factors the average delivery time would be 45 minutes.
